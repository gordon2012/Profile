	* Create a file called `NavBar.js` and a file called `Body.js`
	* `<NavBar />` and `<Body />` will both be React components.  `<NavBar />` should display the title of your page in a larger font.
	* `<Body />` will display some information about yourself.
	* Try adding an image, some text, and some links to your github profile.
